This script adds a list of book titles from a .txt to your To Read shelf on Goodreads via the GoodreadsAPI. If an exact title match is found, the book will be added. If no exact matches are found, the closest match will be added to the To Read shelf with a warning. An error message is printed if no potential matches are found.
